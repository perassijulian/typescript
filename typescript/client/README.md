# Typescript sandbox

Repository made to experiment with projects made in Typescript language. Starting the project using React.js and then integrating it with Node.js. 

### Showcase

It's still on early stage. When there is something to show it will be uploaded to Vercel.

## Focus

First project using Typescript. I am clearly focusing on learning the language, but also on reinforcing my knowledge of all MERN stack since I'm doing it from scratch (as all the ones that I have on Github).

## Concepts

The main concepts that I reaffirmed doing this project were the basic typescript variables declaration, passing props between components, concept of composable component, the use of mapping for rendering, conditional rendering, the use of SASS variables and mixin, etc.

## Main challenges I have faced

### Learning a new languaje

learning a new language is always a challenge. As it is a subset within javascript the learning curve is being very fast. Also, I am quickly realizing the usefulness of having declared variable types as well as interfaces and creating new types.


## Status

It is just beginning. Super WIP.


### Stack

For now, the stack used is React.ts and SASS as CSS processor.
